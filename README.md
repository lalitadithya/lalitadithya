#### A litte more about me
I like to solve problems. Throughout my life, I have been passionately curious to uncover users’ pain points and strategically develop technology driven solutions using Agile methodologies.

This passion for problem solving carried me to the Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services (KSFES - https://www.karnataka.gov.in/ksfes/Pages/Home.aspx) where I identified two major pain points for the employees. One was the extremely paper driven and manual process of getting approvals. The other was the equally cumbersome process of personnel rotation every year. Subsequently I led a team of three engineers to strategically design and develop web-based solutions for alleviating the users’ pain points.

After delivering the two projects on time and within budget at KSFES, I am currently working at Betsol’s “Betsol Innovation Labs” (BIL). Here, I worked with the various stakeholders at Arise Virtual Solutions Inc. (https://www.arise.com/) to understand the product requirements along with various use cases for an existing product. I worked with a cross functional team to execute the product vision which culminated in a decrease in the application’s response time by 96% thereby improving the overall user experience. I was also the SPOC for the project; as a SPOC, I worked with various business stakeholders and engineering teams to on-board clients to the platform.

At BIL, I worked to design and implement a device discovery and pairing process. I implemented several quick and dirty POCs to compare various approaches and after through research, I presented an approach using RFC 8236 for device discovery and pairing. The approach was reviewed by various security consultants and architects after which it was selected to implemented in the product. I implemented the approach using .NET framework in a completely event driven mechanism.

I also enjoy taking photographs on my mobile phone and I also love to travel. You can check out my photographs and some of my travel at https://www.instagram.com/lalitadithya/.
