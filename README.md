#### A litte more about me
I [code](https://github.com/lalitadithya/), [write](/blog), read, and [take photos](https://www.instagram.com/lalitadithya/).

I'm from Bangalore, India and I have been coding since 2010. I have developed, deployed, and maintained websites, desktop apps, and mobile apps. I currently focus on developing & securing cloud native applications.

While in college, I worked with the Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services [KSFES](https://www.karnataka.gov.in/ksfes/Pages/Home.aspx) in their digitization and automation initiative. I led a team of three engineers to developer a web-based application to automate their manual process of getting approvals and their annual personnel rotation. 

Upon graduation, I started working for [Betsol](https://betsol.com). At Betsol, I worked with stakeholders at various levels [Arise Virtual Solutions Inc](https://www.arise.com) to translate product requirements to high level and low level designs for their real time [chat application](https://chat.arise.com). I worked with a cross functional team to execute the product vision. As part of that product vision, I developed a tool using Selenium and JMeter to measure latency of the system under load. I analysed the data gathered by the tool and Azure Application Insights to identify bottlenecks and I worked with the team members to reduce the application‚Äôs response time by 96%. This tool also helped to inform other ops and management decisions such as the amount and type of compute resources needed. I was also the SPOC for the application. 

I designed and implemented a device discovery and pairing process using [RFC 8236](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8236) for [Dell Migate](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/servicesforhome/cp/migrate). I worked with security consultants to prove that MITM and offline attacks are not possible for RFC 8236 and I implemented the approach using .NET framework in a completely async event driven fashion. I also worked with architects to design and implement a message routing framework using reflection that aided in integration with Dell's Support Assist. The message routing framework increased developer productivity and reduced code duplication. 

I worked with architects to architect and design a cloud native backup solution for Rebit 2.0. I also worked with various stakeholders to translate the product vision to user stories and low level design. I'm currently working with the team to implement the cloud native backup solution.
